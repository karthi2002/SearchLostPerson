Project Setup and Start Guide

This guide will help you set up and start the project by navigating to the client and server directories, installing dependencies, and running the project.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

Steps

1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, run:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. Change Directory to Client

Navigate to the client directory:

```sh
cd client
```

3. Install Client Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the client:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Start the Client

After installing the dependencies, start the client:

```sh
npm start
```

5. Open a New Terminal and Change Directory to Server

Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the server directory:

```sh
cd server
```

6. Install Server Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the server:

```sh
npm install
```

7. Start the Server

After installing the dependencies, start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

8. Access the Project

Once both the client and server are running, you can access the project in your web browser. The client is usually available at `http://localhost:3000` and the server at `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured).

Notes

- If the project structure or commands differ, please update the paths and commands accordingly.
- Ensure both the client and server are running concurrently for the full project functionality.

- If you encounter any issues during `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
- Ensure that there are no port conflicts when starting the client and server.

Following these steps will set up and start your project successfully. For any further assistance, refer to the project documentation or contact the project maintainers.

Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_directory>` with your actual repository URL and directory name. Adjust any specific paths or commands as necessary based on your project's structure and configuration.
